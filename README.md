# Fork

This repo has been forked from https://github.com/Homers3D/Tevo-Tornado

**This firmware is not suitable for standard Tevo Tornados!** Please check the link above for the original firmware.

This firmware was adjusted for a modified Tevo Tornado I built from spare parts. Differences to the main model:

- Double-Z-Axis with 2 spindles and 2 motors
- The ACME spindles have a slope of 1.5mm where the original has an 8mm slope. You may ask, why? Well the 8mm spindles were sold out at the moment I gathered the missing parts.
- Also I adjusted a few things in the xy according to my findings from Cura.
